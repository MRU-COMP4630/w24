# Journal Club Guidelines
For journal club, you will have one of two roles: presenter or participant. Here are some guidelines for each role.

## Participant
As a participant, you are expected to:
- Read the paper at a high level before the meeting
- Write down your thoughts or questions about the paper. This can include:
    - Clarification about a confusing part of the paper
    - Why the authors made certain choices
    - Questions about how the paper relates to other work
    - Criticism of the methods or results
- Attend the meeting
- Ask questions and participate in the discussion

## Presenter
As the presenter, you are expected to become the "expert" on the paper. This means you should:
- Read the paper thoroughly, and likely multiple times
- Understand the paper's methods and results
- Prepare a presentation (guidelines to follow)
- Present to the group and lead the discussion
- Share your own opinions and thoughts about the paper

## Presentation Guidelines
Your presentation should be no more than 15 minutes long, and while it may follow pretty much any format, here are some suggested questions to think about while you structure your presentation:

1. **Introduction**
    - What is the problem the paper is trying to solve?
    - What is the basic approach?
    - What is the paper's main contribution(s)?
2. **Methods**
    - Describe the data set used in the paper (where it came from, what preprocessing was used, quantity, etc) 
    - Describe the model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, training process, etc.
    - Highlight anything novel, interesting, or confusing about the methods
    - Is there an open source implementation published by the authors or others? If so, are the results reproducible?
3. **Results**
    - What are the main results, and how do they compare to previous work?
    - Is there anything about the results that is surprising or questionable?
4. **Discussion**
    - What do the authors conclude from their results?
    - What do you find the most interesting about the paper?
    - What are some limitations of the paper? These could be limitations described by the authors, or issues that you see with the paper.
    - If you were to continue this work, what would you do next?

Not all of these questions will be relevant for every paper, and there may be other points that come to mind as you read the paper. The key thing is to be prepared to lead a discussion about the paper, which means reading it thoroughly!
